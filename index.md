During the event, teams will collaborate on projects aimed at harnessing the potential of large language models, in topics such as generating novel chemical compound structures, optimizing materials for specific applications, predicting material properties, automating synthesis routes, and more. By fusing state-of-the-art AI techniques with deep scientific knowledge, the hackathon aims to accelerate research and development in materials and chemistry.

Join us for the excitement of innovation, collaboration, and discovery as we push the boundaries of what's possible in materials science and chemistry using large language models. Prepare to be amazed by the groundbreaking solutions that will emerge from this cutting-edge hackathon!

## Logistics

The event will take place virtually, using a combination of **video
conferencing** (Zoom) for meetings and seminars, and **discussion forums**
(Slack, Miro). Slack, Miro, and Zoom links will be shared upon registration. 

In parallel, there will be a series of on-site events at locations around the world. These events will be organized by local hosts and will be connected to the main event via video conferencing. You can find a list of local events on the [Local Events](/local_events) page.

## Prizes

Will be announced soon!
